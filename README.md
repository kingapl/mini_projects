## Collatz conjecture
This app asks the user for a positive natural number, then from that number it performs calculations until the number is one.

## Fibonacci sequence
This project asks the user for a number and then displays as many Fibonacci numbers as the user wanted.

## Find numbers
The program that finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list.

## Fizzbuzz
This program shows the user a hundred numbers, however, if the number is divisible by 3, it shows "Fizz", if the number is divisible by 5, it shows "Buzz", and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, the program shows "FizzBuzz".

## Guess the number
This project is a mini game. Computer draws a number and asks the user to guess the number.

## Palindrome
This application reverses a user-written string and checks if is palindrome.

## Reverse string
This application reverses a user-written string.

## Words counter
In this project user is prompted to enter text and next the program counts words in the string.

## Technologies
Python 3.8.

## Setup
The all applications must be run in the console or the terminal depending on the computer system.
